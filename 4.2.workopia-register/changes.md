## Now to start implementation in register view, will add method="POST" and action="/auth/register". Will then add it to route where going to UserController, it'll go to store method. All the details are followed up from here then. 
## We will send error array to create.view.php from UserController in case it's not empty and has some fields containing validation error like email. As it's part of dry code so we'll just make simple error partial and pass error arr to it. Since loadPartial don't have ability to take in arr as 2nd arg like loadView so we'll add that ability in helper func. Used this partial to refactor create and edit file under listing folder too.
