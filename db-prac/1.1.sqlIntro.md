# Create Table
```sql 
CREATE TABLE posts(
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, -- As set to auto increment so no need to later enter any value
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, 
    body TEXT NOT NULL, -- As body characters will be longer than 255 so will just keep it text
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- will show timestamp at time of post creation. By default will put current timestamp so no need to enter manually
); 

```
