## Now for dynamic navbar, Since we're logged in so we don't need register and login btn and instead need logout. We'll go to navbar partial in workopia\views\partials and add if/else statement then use has method of Session and will also retrieve from session key user as it's assoc arr to take user name
## Will also make logout route in routes.php and logout method in UserController. On form where logout btn resides in, action will be request '/auth/logout' sent to route.php and method will be post then that request will be completed by defined logout method from UserController as given in routes.php
